/**
 * Classify how a game entered the library, for the per-store library tabs.
 *
 * Design goal (hard requirement): a game that is owned on / synced from ANY
 * official store must NEVER appear under the Retigga (catalogue) tab, and a
 * GameHub repack must never leak into a platform tab. Because `libraryOrigin`
 * is a single mutable field that several import paths fail to stamp (Steam
 * free-to-play titles, cloud-profile imports, legacy pre-stamp records), we do
 * NOT trust its absence. Instead we resolve from the strongest signals first:
 *
 *   1. custom shop / explicit "custom" stamp           → "custom"
 *   2. explicit "sync" stamp OR a platform-URI exe     → "sync"   (owned wins)
 *   3. a GameHub download record                       → "catalog" (it's a repack)
 *   4. explicit "catalog" stamp                        → "catalog"
 *   5. anything else                                   → "catalog" (unverified)
 *
 * Step 5 sends UNVERIFIED records to Retigga rather than a platform tab. This
 * is safe for genuinely-owned games because every platform sync stamps BOTH
 * libraryOrigin="sync" AND (for Steam) a steam://run/ URI exe, so owned titles
 * are always caught by steps 1–2 before reaching here. Only records that have
 * never been through a platform sync — e.g. Playnite imports of games you do
 * NOT own on any store — fall through to step 5, which is exactly where they
 * belong: Retigga, not Steam/Epic/GOG.
